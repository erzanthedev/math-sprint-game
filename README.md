# 🧮 Math Sprint Game Project 🧮

Welcome to my Math Sprint Game project! This game challenges you with random equations, asking you to select whether they are right or wrong. At the end, it evaluates your answers, displays your best time, and includes any penalties incurred from incorrect answers.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

I started this project with a CSS and a tad JS template to quickly build the UI, and added JavaScript to handle the game logic, including calculating correct and incorrect answers.

## ✨ Purpose

The primary goal of this project was to learn how to use JavaScript to build the following features:

- **Splash Page**: Display a welcome page where users can select the number of questions they want to answer.
- **Countdown Page**: Show a countdown before the game starts.
- **Game Page**: Generate random equations and display them to the user.
- **Equation Generation**: Create random equations and populate them into the DOM.
- **Score Checking**: Calculate the user's score with timing events.
- **Score Page**: Display the final score and update the best scores using local storage.

## 📚 What I Learned

- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Improved my skills in JavaScript, particularly in handling events and managing game logic.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Enhanced my ability to dynamically create and update DOM elements.
- **Local Storage**: Gained experience with local storage to save and retrieve user data.
- **User Interaction**: Learned how to create an engaging user experience with interactive elements.
